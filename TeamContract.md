ECE 3400, Fall 2018 
Team # 13
Team Members: Ian Switzer, Alberto Lopez Delgado, Hadi Alzayer, Yanrui Wang

Day, time, and place for regular team meetings:
UH142, Friday 11.15-12.05pm, weekly. (We suggest allocating more time towards the end of the semester)
Lab time, Wednesdays 7:30-10:30
Sundays at 7:30 am, 1 hour unless otherwise necessary

Preferred method of communication in order to inform each other of team meetings, announcement, updates, reminders, problems:
The team will use the app GroupMe as the main means of communication. We will also share relevant content and media via email and gitHub.

Decision-making policy (by consensus? by majority vote?):
Unanimous, baring unnecessary delays (>1 meeting).

Method for setting and following meeting agendas (Who will set each agenda? When? How will team members be notified/reminded? Who will be responsible for the team following the agenda during a team meeting? What will be done to keep the team on track during a meeting?):
Group discussions on a meeting by meeting basis on what “in general” will get done. A general overview for semester long agenda will be decided by the group in an early meeting.

Method of record keeping (Who will be responsible for recording & disseminating minutes? How & when will the minutes be disseminated? Where will all agendas & minutes be kept?):
Team member Alberto will be responsible for recording and disseminating meeting minutes. They will be kept in a separate section on the website. 

Work Quality:
Project standards (What is a realistic level of quality for team presentations, collaborative writing, individual research, preparation of drafts, peer reviews, etc.?):
We all want to do very well in this course, so we choose to hold all elements to a high level of quality. That includes:
Well worked presentations
Detailed, clear documentation
Peer Review of all major code

	We are going to win this thing!!! Those t-shirts better come in Medium size.

Strategies to fulfill these standards:
GitHub - Version Control
Robot must pass drop tests

Team Participation:
Strategies to ensure cooperation and equal distribution of tasks:
Peer mentor and subteam
Team member will mentor coding, presentation and website skills to one another, especially in talented areas 
Distributed coding task in lab session
Encourage people who don’t have a lot of experience with a task to try it out and learn

Strategies for encouraging/including ideas from all team members (team maintenance):
Brainstorm during team meetings 
Every team member should share own thoughts and ideas on specific issues
All members are encouraged to present any ideas they might have, regardless of how “good” they are
Other members must fully hear this idea out, but are allowed to provide honest criticism
No “ownership” of ideas. Members will not get defensive when their ideas are criticized. Once an idea is presented, it is no longer an individual’s idea, it belongs to the group.

Strategies for keeping on task (task maintenance):
Each person will walk away from every meeting with assigned “tasks” which they are expected to complete by certain deadlines. Consistently missing these deadlines will lead to evaluation of that person’s position on the team and shall count as “Failing to Follow Procedure and Fulfill Expectations”;
Preferences for leadership (informal, formal, individual, shared):
Informal
Personal Accountability:
Expected individual attendance, punctuality, and participation at all team meetings:
Team members are all expected to show up within 5 minutes of a meetings planned start time. If a member is consistently late, we will evaluate whether they need the meeting time to be modified.

Expected level of responsibility for fulfilling team assignments, timelines, and deadlines:
Responsibility increases exponentially with time as the semester passes. It blows to infinity when limit of time approaches competition deadline.

Expected level of communication with other team members:
All team members are expected to maintain effective and consistent communication. Up until week 13 of classes, urgent messages should be answered within 12 hours. After week 13, all members should respond to urgent messages within an hour. Urgent messages are all messages concerning the correct functioning of our robot.

Expected level of commitment to team decisions and tasks:
All Team 13-ers are given the same power of decision, and hence share the same level of responsibility. Team members must fulfill their assigned responsibilities within the agreed deadline. Exceptions will be considered in appropriate cases as determined by the rest of the team.

Consequences for Failing to Follow Procedures and Fulfill Expectations
Describe, as a group, you would handle infractions of any of the obligations of this team contract:
The group will discuss it in a meeting, and consider ways to make it easier on said violator to avoid future infractions. 
Describe what your team will do if the infractions continue:
Should infractions ensue, a mugshot of the infractor will be placed in the Hall of Shame, right at the top of the team’s website.
