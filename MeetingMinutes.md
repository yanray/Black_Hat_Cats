### Meeting minutes:

8/31/18 - We started the meeting with all team members present. The team crafted the Team Contract, which can be accessed anytime from our website.

9/7/18 - All team members are present today. Today we worked on finishing uploading the content of Lab 1 to the website. Hadi focused on uploading the code blocks, Yanrui worked on embedding the videos of the robot from his Youtube page, Ian uploaded the content of the sonic guidance system he implemented last week, and Alberto uploaded the content for the assembly process. We agreed to start working on line-following and FFT libraries during next lab session.

9/14/18 - The meeting started with all black hat cats present. Today we worked in creating the report for Milestone 1. We realized our figure 8 procedure had room for improvement, so we decided to go to the lab later in the day to implement some changes. Ian proposed to use omni-wheels to navigate the maze without having to turn, thus giving us the chance to build a faster robot; we decided to create a prototype while having a working robot with regular wheels, taking costs into account.
