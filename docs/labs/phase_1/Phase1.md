# Lab 1: Microcontroller

[Home](https://yanray.github.io/Black_Hat_Cats/)

### Objective
Learn basics of Arduino io by controlling LEDs and motors
Assemble basic body for a robot and use the Arduino to move in a basic square

### Teams
**subteam 1**: Hadi Alzayer, Alberto Lopez Delgado

**subteam 2**: Yanrui Wang , Ian Switzer

## step 1: Pre-lab work

[Click here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) to download Arduino IDE.

After install Arduino IDE, you will see this.

## step 2: Internal LED Blink

**Firstly**, Open Ardunio IDE -> File -> Examples -> 1.Basics -> Blink

**Then**, Click **Checkmark** to compile code -> Click **right arrow** to upload your code to Arduino

**Luckily**, The Internal LED blinks, see the video below.

*Warning!!*  Make sure your Arduino IDE is connected to right COM port. Click Tools -> Serial Port list to see.

[We need a place to put code and need some explanation for code !!! please]

## step 3: External LED Blink

After Internal LED Blink, Let us Blink an External LED ! 

Pick up a LED and a Resistor. [Need Picture of LED and Resistor here !!!!]

**Then**, Connect LED and Resistor on breadboard, use a different Pin and modify code to blink Internal LED. 

**Great!**, The External LED blinks, see the video below.

*Warning!!*  Make sure your LED is connected to a Resistor at least 300ohm. Unless you want to blow up your Arduino.

## step 4: Read the potentiometer 

After External LED Blink, Let us Read Analog value of Potentiometer ! 

Pick up a Potentiometer and a Resistor. [Need Picture of LED and Resistor here !!!!]

**Then**, Connect Potentiometer and Resistor on breadboard, use the Analog Pin A0 and write code to read the value. Remember click **Serial monitor** to see the value. (on the top right)
**Cool !**, Get the value of Potentiometer, see the video below.

*Warning!!*  Make sure your Potentiometer is connected to a Resistor at least 300ohm. Unless you want to blow up your Arduino.

## step 5: Analog Output (PWM)

## step 6: Parallax Servos 

## step 7: Assemble Impressive Robot 

## step 8: Make the Robot Go !
